# 📖 Yaycha — Learning Project

This is **Yaycha**, a social media platform project I’m building while following along with **Rock Star Developer 2025** by *Sayar Ei Maung*. It allows users to create posts, interact with others through likes and comments, follow users, and explore the latest updates from their network.

👉 It’s not a finished app. I’m just copying, practicing, and learning from the book step by step.
