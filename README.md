# 📖 Yaycha — Learning Project

This is **Yaycha**, a social media platform project I’m building while following along with
**Rock Star Developer 2025** by *Sayar Ei Maung*.

👉 It’s not a finished app (yet). I’m just copying, practicing, and learning from the book step by step.

## 🚧 What’s Here (so far)

* 📝 Posts (basic)
* 👍 Likes
* 💬 Comments

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Learning

## 💡 Why This Exists

This repo is mostly for me:

* To track my progress 📈
* To practice coding while following the book
* To have fun building something, even if it’s not perfect 🎉

---

## 🚀 Running It

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/yaycha.git](https://github.com/Myatthu17/yaycha.git)
cd yaycha
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then it will automatically open 👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🙌 Credits
